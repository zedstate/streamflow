- **Pipeline 1.5**: Pipeline 1 + scheduled complete checks (balanced approach)
- **Pipeline 2**: Updates and matching only, no automatic checking (minimal connection usage)
- **Pipeline 2.5**: Pipeline 2 + scheduled complete checks (controlled automation)
- **Pipeline 3**: Only scheduled operations (maximum control)

See [PIPELINE_SYSTEM.md](PIPELINE_SYSTEM.md) for detailed pipeline documentation.

### Automated M3U Playlist Management
- Automatically refreshes playlists every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Detects playlist changes in real-time
- Updates channels immediately when M3U refreshes
- Tracks update history in changelog
- **M3U Priority System**: Configure stream selection priority
  - **Global Priority Mode**: Default mode that applies to all M3U accounts unless overridden
    - Disabled: Priority ignored, streams selected by quality only
    - Same Resolution Only: Priority applied within same resolution groups
    - All Streams: Always prefer higher priority accounts regardless of quality
  - Per-account priority values (0-100) set in Dispatcharr
  - Per-account priority mode override (optional): Can override global setting for specific accounts
  - Priority fields disabled when global mode is "disabled"
  - Only enabled/active playlists shown in priority UI

### Intelligent Stream Quality Checking
Multi-factor analysis of stream quality using a single optimized ffmpeg call:
- **Bitrate**: Average kbps measurement
- **Resolution**: Width × height detection
- **Frame Rate**: FPS analysis
- **Video Codec**: H.265/H.264 identification with automatic sanitization
  - Filters out invalid codec names (e.g., "wrapped_avframe", "unknown")
  - Extracts actual codec from hardware-accelerated streams
- **Audio Codec**: Detection and validation
  - Parses **input stream codecs** only (e.g., "aac", "ac3", "mp3", "eac3")
  - Avoids decoded output formats (e.g., "pcm_s16le")
  - Supports multiple audio streams and language tracks
- **Error Detection**: Decode errors, discontinuities, timeouts
- **Optimized Performance**: Single ffmpeg call instead of separate ffprobe+ffmpeg (reduced overhead)
- **Parallel Checking**: Thread-based concurrent analysis with configurable worker pool
  - Proper pipeline: gather stats in parallel → when ALL checks finish → push info to Dispatcharr
  - Prevents race conditions during concurrent operations

### Automatic Stream Reordering
- Best quality streams automatically moved to top
- Quality score calculation (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Configurable scoring weights
- Preserves stream availability

### Stream Discovery
- **Regex Pattern Matching**: Automatic stream-to-channel assignment based on patterns
  - **Automatic Validation**: Invalid regex patterns are automatically detected and removed on load
  - **Self-Healing Configuration**: Corrupted patterns won't persist across restarts
  - **Clear Error Messages**: Log warnings indicate which patterns were removed and why
- **Table-Based Interface**: Clean, sortable table layout for managing regex patterns across channels
- **Mass Assignment**: Add a single regex pattern to multiple channels at once
  - Multi-select channels with checkboxes
  - Select All/Deselect All functionality
  - Group filtering to show only channels from specific groups
  - Group sorting for organized view
- **Channel Name Variables**: Use `CHANNEL_NAME` in patterns to create reusable regex rules
  - Pattern example: `.*CHANNEL_NAME.*` matches any stream containing the channel name
  - One pattern works for multiple channels with different names
  - Variables are substituted at match time, not storage time
  - **Resilient Design**: Fully supports channel names with special characters (+, ., *, [], (), |, etc.), unicode, and emoji
  - **Security**: Automatic escaping prevents regex injection attacks
  - **Note**: Patterns with `CHANNEL_NAME` are fully supported in validation, live preview, and actual matching
- **Pattern Testing Interface**: Live testing of patterns against available streams
- **Pattern Import/Export**: Share regex configurations across installations
- **New Stream Detection**: Automatically detects and assigns new streams on playlist refresh
- **Health Check Buttons**: Quick access to stream quality checks
  - Individual channel health check button with Activity icon next to expand/collapse
  - Bulk health check for all selected channels

  - Loading states with spinner animations
  - Tooltip guidance for better UX

## Quality Analysis

### Scoring Formula
**Total Score = (Bitrate × 0.30) + (Resolution × 0.25) + (FPS × 0.15) + (Codec × 0.10) + (Errors × 0.20)**

### Configurable Weights
```json
{
  "weights": {
    "bitrate": 0.30,      // Default: 30%
    "resolution": 0.25,   // Default: 25%
    "fps": 0.15,          // Default: 15%
    "codec": 0.10,        // Default: 10%
    "errors": 0.20        // Default: 20%
  }
}
```

### Codec Preferences
- H.265/HEVC preference: Higher score for modern codecs
- Interlaced penalty: Lower score for interlaced content
- Dropped frames penalty: Lower score for streams with frame drops

### Sequential and Parallel Checking
- **Parallel Mode** (default): Concurrent stream checking with configurable worker pool (default: 10)
  - Thread-based parallel execution
  - Configurable global concurrency limit
  - **Per-Account Stream Limits**: Respects maximum concurrent streams for each M3U account
    - Smart scheduler ensures account limits are never exceeded
    - Multiple accounts can check streams in parallel
    - Example: Account A (limit: 1), Account B (limit: 2) with streams A1, A2, B1, B2, B3
      - Concurrently checks: A1, B1, B2 (3 total, respecting limits)
      - When A1 completes, A2 starts; when B1/B2 completes, B3 starts
  - Stagger delay to prevent simultaneous starts
  - Robust pipeline: all stats gathered in parallel, then pushed to Dispatcharr after ALL checks complete
  - Prevents race conditions with dead stream removal
- **Sequential Mode**: One stream at a time for minimal provider load
- Queue-based processing
- Real-time progress tracking

### Dead Stream Detection and Management
Automatically identifies and manages non-functional streams:
- **Detection**: Streams with resolution=0 or bitrate=0 are marked as dead
- **Changelog Tracking**: Dead streams show status "dead" in changelog (not score:0)
- **Revival Tracking**: Revived streams show status "revived" in changelog
- **Removal**: Dead streams are removed from channels during regular checks
- **Matching Exclusion**: Dead streams are not assigned to channels during stream matching
- **Pipeline-Aware**: Only operates in pipelines with stream checking enabled (1, 1.5, 2.5, 3)

#### Dead Stream Revival: Global Action vs Single Channel Check
There is an important difference in how dead streams are handled:

**Global Action** (gives ALL dead streams a second chance):
1. **Step 1**: Refresh UDI cache
2. **Step 2**: Clear ALL dead streams from tracker (giving them a second chance)
3. **Step 3**: Update all M3U playlists
4. **Step 4**: Match and assign streams (including previously dead ones since tracker was cleared)
5. **Step 5**: Check all channels (force check bypasses immunity)
6. **Result**: ALL previously dead streams can be re-added and re-checked

**Single Channel Check** (gives dead streams for THAT CHANNEL a second chance):
1. **Step 1**: Identify M3U accounts used by the channel
2. **Step 2**: Refresh playlists for those M3U accounts
3. **Step 3**: Clear dead streams for THAT CHANNEL from tracker (giving them a second chance)
4. **Step 4**: Re-match and assign streams (if matching_mode is enabled for the channel)
5. **Step 5**: Force check all streams (if checking_mode is enabled for the channel, bypasses 2-hour immunity)
6. **Result**: Dead streams for that channel are cleared and can be re-added and re-checked

**Channel Settings Override**:
Single Channel Check respects per-channel `matching_mode` and `checking_mode` settings:
- If `matching_mode='disabled'`: Stream matching (Step 4) is skipped
- If `checking_mode='disabled'`: Stream quality checking (Step 5) is skipped
- Steps 1-3 (playlist refresh, dead stream clearing) always execute regardless of settings
- This allows users to configure channels individually (e.g., match but don't check, or check but don't match)

**Why the difference?**
- Global Action is the comprehensive system-wide operation that clears the slate and gives every stream a fresh chance
- Single Channel Check is a targeted operation that only affects the specified channel
- This ensures efficient targeted operations while respecting per-channel configuration

**When dead streams get a second chance:**
- During scheduled Global Actions (pipelines 1.5, 2.5, and 3)
- During manually triggered Global Actions
- During Single Channel Check for that specific channel
- When streams are manually re-added to channels outside of the automated system

## EPG-Based Scheduling

### Scheduled Channel Checks Before Events
Schedule channel checks to run before EPG program events for optimal stream quality:
- **EPG Integration**: Fetches program data from Dispatcharr's EPG grid endpoint
- **Automatic Refresh**: Background processor automatically fetches EPG data periodically
  - Configurable refresh interval (default: 60 minutes, minimum: 5 minutes)
  - Auto-starts with the application
  - First refresh occurs 5 seconds after startup
  - Continues running in the background
- **Program Search**: Browse upcoming programs by channel
- **Flexible Timing**: Configure minutes before program start to run the check
- **Playlist Updates**: Playlist refresh triggered before scheduled checks
- **Event Management**: Create, view, and delete scheduled events

### User Workflow - Manual Event Creation
1. Navigate to Scheduling section in the UI
2. Click "Add Event Check" button
3. Select a channel from searchable dropdown
4. View and select from channel's upcoming programs
5. Specify minutes before program start for the check
6. Save the scheduled event
7. Monitor scheduled events in table with channel logos and program details

### User Workflow - Auto-Create Rules
1. Navigate to Scheduling section in the UI
2. Click "Create Auto-Create Rule" button
3. Configure rule name
4. Select channels:
   - **Individual Channels**: Choose specific channels from the dropdown
   - **Channel Groups**: Select entire channel groups (automatically includes all current and future channels in the group)
   - **Mixed Selection**: Combine both individual channels and channel groups in a single rule
5. Define regex pattern to match program titles
6. Test pattern against live EPG data (optional)
7. Set minutes before program start for the check
8. Save the rule
9. Events are automatically created as EPG refreshes
10. New channels added to selected groups are automatically included - no updates required!

**Benefits of Channel Groups:**
- Automatically applies rules to all channels in a group
- New channels added to the group are included automatically
- No manual updates needed when channels change
- Perfect for dynamic channel groups (e.g., sports event channels created by Teamarr)

**Example Use Case:**
- Create a rule for "NBA Teamarr" channel group
- Use regex pattern: `(?i)^(?:coming up:\s*)?NBA Basketball`
- All NBA event channels get pre-event stream checks automatically
- When Teamarr creates new event channels, they're included without updates
