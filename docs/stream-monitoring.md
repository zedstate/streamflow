# Stream Monitoring

## Overview
Stream Monitoring is a live health tracking system that runs independently of the main automation pipeline. It maintains a session for each active stream and continuously evaluates quality, reliability, and content accuracy using a multi-layered approach.

## 1. FFmpeg Router & Sidecars
The system employs an efficient "Main + Sidecar" architecture for each monitored stream:

- **Main Monitor ([FFmpegStreamMonitor](file:///Users/anderregidor/AceStream%20Project/streamflow/backend/ffmpeg_stream_monitor.py#43-419))**: Captures high-level telemetry like bitrate, FPS, and speed. It uses health monitoring outputs to detect buffering or terminal failures.
- **Sidecar Detectors**: Specialized processes spawned alongside the main monitor to perform computationally intensive tasks without blocking the telemetry loop.

### Sidecar Mechanism Workflow

    D --> E["Sidecar FFmpeg (Fast-Bilinear Gray Scale)"]
    E --> F[PPM Image Pipe]
    F --> G[CV Analyzer: Loop Detection]
    G --> H[Status Update]
```

## 2. Looping Detection Mechanism
The loop detector analyzes frames in the PPM pipe. It maintains a short-term buffer of frame signatures (simplified as grayscale signatures) and checks for repeating sequences that indicate a stream is "looping".

- **Penalty**: 50 points are deducted from the reliability score immediately upon loop detection.
- **Quarantine**: If a stream is confirmed to be looping, it is marked as [looping](file:///Users/anderregidor/AceStream%20Project/streamflow/backend/sidecar_loop_detector.py#46-49) and moved to quarantine.

## 3. Stability Score: Capped Sliding Window
Reliability is measured using the **Capped Sliding Window** algorithm. This ensures that scores reflect recent performance while dampening sudden variance to prevent "flapping" in Dispatcharr.

### Scoring Mechanism
- **Healthy Measurement**: Stream alive + Speed > 0.9x = **1.0 points**
- **Buffering Measurement**: Stream alive + Speed < 0.9x = **0.3 points**
- **Dead Measurement**: Stream dead = **0 points**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Window [Sliding Window: size=60]
        M1[1.0] --- M2[1.0] --- M3[0.3] --- M4[1.0] --- M5[0.0]
    end
    Window --> Avg["Average Health"]
    Avg --> Damp["Dampening (avg ^ 1.5)"]
    Damp --> Score["Final Reliability Score (0-100)"]
```

## 4. Logo Detection: 4-Pillar Architecture
The logo verification system ensures the content matches the expected channel using a resilient 4-pillar CV system:
1. **Edge Density**: Skips verification on black screens or whip-pans to avoid false negatives.
2. **Multi-Corner Fallback**: Checks top-right; falls back to top-left if needed.
3. **Cross-Stream Consensus**: Grants a "Global Pardon" during commercial breaks if all streams fail simultaneously.
4. **Auto-Quarantine**: Outliers failing 4 consecutive checks are immediately quarantined.

    participant S as Stream
    participant D as Edge Density Check
    participant V as Logo Verifier
    participant C as Global Consensus
    participant Q as Quarantine Logic

    S->>D: Capture Screenshot
    D->>D: Dense enough?
    alt Black Screen/No Edges
        D-->>S: Skip Verification
    else Valid Content
        D->>V: Match Corner 1 (Top-Right)
        alt Found
            V-->>C: Mark SUCCESS
        else Not Found
            V->>V: Fallback: Match Corner 2 (Top-Left)
            alt Found
                V-->>C: Mark SUCCESS
            else None Found
                V-->>C: Mark FAILED
            end
        end
    end
    C->>C: Evaluate All Streams
    alt All FAILED
        C-->>Q: Global Pardon (Commercial)
    else Mixed Results
        C->>Q: Penalize Outliers
    end
```

## 5. Lifecycle: Quarantine & Review
- **Stable**: Reliable streams ranked by score and resolution.
- **Review**: Streams in "probation" after recovery or initial start.
- **Quarantined**: Streams showing wrong content or dead. Includes specific UI badges for `Looping` (with duration) and `Logo Mismatch` (with screenshot).

---

## 6. Efficiency & Stability
The system is optimized for high-performance monitoring:

- **Threaded Synchronization**: Rank updates to Dispatcharr are threaded to prevent blocking telemetry.
- **Log Debouncing**: Penalty warnings are throttled to 1/minute per stream.
- **Unified Evaluation**: Synchronized timestamps ensure metric alignment across the session.

---

## 7. Monitoring Dashboard & Visibility
- **Logo Verify Status**: Shows CV status (SUCCESS/FAILED/PENDING) and failure counts.
- **Quarantine Badges**: Shows specific reasons like `Looping (15.5s)` or `Logo Mismatch` (with failing screenshot).
- **Live Previews**: Horizontally-scrolling carousel of live screenshots across all active streams.
